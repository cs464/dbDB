1. Type 'sudo -s'

2. Type 'bash createTablesForProject.sh' to create all of our tables, and make sure you change the user name in the file -- you can do this with a text editor. 

3. Type 'bash destroyAll.sh' to delete all of the tables in our database. Really think about this before doing it, as it could be really shitty if it was on accident.
